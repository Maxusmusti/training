# BACKEND TRAINING BITS

This repo contains the minimum necessary bits for the deepspeed training container.

NOTE: All references to IBM internal repos have been removed (specifically the GPTMegatron import from `main_ds.py`)

(Instructions on building and using the backend training image will be added here, for now see the Red Hat internal [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZhjVfJ3eGsNtDh4cm3xfU1uQKVdsE46TGU9QCu7HBk/edit?usp=sharing))
